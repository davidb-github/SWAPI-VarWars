                <br>

                <p>It is a time of unrest. A computer virus has infected the galaxy, crippling trade, and forcing
                    civilizations to fight over basic necessities like toilet paper. A young coder named Ima Noobie
                    detected a flaw in the malicious software and has devised a plot to restore trade and bring peace to
                    the galaxy.</p>
                <br>

                <p>Young Noobie discovered the source code originated on a moon-sized space station called The Breath
                    Star, capable of transmitting the virus to systems up to six light years away. The code was
                    written by a ruthless hacker named Java the Script in an attempt to extort and enslave billions.</p>
                <br>

                <p>Ima has assembled a team of leading pilots, developers, and software epidemiologists to race towards
                    The Breath Star in hopes
                    of covering it with a giant mask, thereby blocking the space station's two main exhaust ports and
                    further preventing the spread of the malicious virus. Once the station is incapacitated, the team
                    will attempt to
                    refactor the evil code to send a patch out to all infected systems in effort to restore peace.</p>
                <br>

                <p>Here is a list of the starships Noobie will be using in his fight to save the galaxy:</p>
